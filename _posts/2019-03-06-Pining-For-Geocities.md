Yeah, I know - this blog looks like it time-warped here from 1997. 

It's **perfect** :heart:  

I'm not ignorant to the irony of preferring a very retro, very outdated, very simplistic blog platform while simultaneously trying to learn the latest and greatest in JavaScript development. As I so often hear about the English language, you have to learn the rules so you can know how to break them.

Even as web design gets sleeker, smoother, and more feature-oriented, there's something very comforting to me about the simplicity of an HTML table and high contrast color. I came into web design at the advent of HTML 4 in my very early teens.
