I got into Docker two years ago on an Ubuntu machine at home. I went through the tutorial, pulled down a MongoDB image, and successfully spun up an empty database. It was neat. 

I've done exactly nothing with it since. 

The problem sometimes with being a Windows admin by trade is that I fall behind the curve on game-changing technology like containers. What was a quick and painless exercise in Ubuntu 14 proved a needless headache in Windows Server 2016. Even if our .NET developers were breaking down the door to demand containers on Windows (and they weren't) there was no way for me to provide the same robust solutions as my RedHat compatriots down the hall. 

I am finally encouraged by this week's news that Windows Server 2019 containers can take full advantage of Kubernetes, but I'll confess I have absolutely no idea what that really means in terms of real world application. Does this mean that Windows containers are now a viable solution for my app teams? Are we on par with Linux in terms of delivery ease and usage? Or will I still be jumping through extra hoops and Macguyvering fixes to achieve something that Linux admins have provided effortlessly for years now?

I'm attending my first DockerCon in a month, so I hope to both learn the answers to these questions and find those answers satisfying. At the very least, I hope the swag is nice.
